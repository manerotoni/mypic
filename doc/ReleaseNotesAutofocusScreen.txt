AutofocusScreen for ZEN v2.1.2 - Release notes
This document list all the features, enhancements and changes to the AutofocusScreen Macro
For detailed information of using AutofocusScreen please refer to the User’s Manual
Requirements
ZEN2010 or ZEN2011 (Black Edition) a microscope LSM710/780 (Macro v2.1 has only been tested on a LSM780)

Changes
* Updated documentation
* Imaging settings in “Micropilot” and “Additional Image” have the same options (Frame-Size, offset etc)
* “Sub-positions”: Center of subgrid is the Well/position
* “MaxSpeed”: When clicked pixel dwell time for track used in Autofocus is maximal and independent of pixel dwell time used for Acquisition. In v2.0 pixel dwell times were the same.
* “ScanFrame”: The user needs to specify whether X and Y positions should be updated according to centre of mass (“TrackXY” ). In v2.0 this option was always on.
* Uniform usage of “Active” button for the Macro
* Cross-dependency of functions is visualised by letting enabling features or not (e.g. “piezo” and “FastZline” are mutually exclusive)
* File naming changed in conformity with Cell-Base. 
      BaseFileName_Wxxx_Pyyy_Tzzz.lsm 
      xxx =  : Position/Well Nr., yyy = Subposition Nr.; zzz: Repetition Nr.
Wells and positions are named from left to right and visited in a meandering mode, e.g.  W001, W002, W003, W006, W005, W003
* “GridScan”: The specification of one position is required. With more than one position the first is taken. This allows to correctly restart the experiment
* “GridScan”:  X and Y in are now  called Column and Rows

Additions
*  “FastZLine”:  The users can separately decide whether to use FastZline in absence of piezo.  This mode is fast but less precise.  In v2.1 FastZline was activated with “Max Speed”
* “Save AFImage”: This saves the images acquired with the Autofocus channel
* “LineSize”: In ScanLine mode the user can change the size of the line scanned. Shorter line allows for faster computation
* “STOP after repetition”: This button stops when current repetition is finished
* Administration of different localization is uniform. After STOP Macro can return to first position. 
* Macros asks if a set of file should be overwritten or not.
* Extensive logging of experiment
* Shows current physical positions, repetitions, column etc. 

Fixes
* “ZStep”: In ScanLine mode, with FastZline and absence of piezo any Z Step < 1.54 um is possible. The macro calculates the required pixel dwell time. In v2.0 large Z-Steps were wrongly sets resulting is a incorrectly sized Z-stack
* Macro without piezo works with a significantly increased precision for all acquisition and autofocus modes. In version v2.0 there where random jumps in focus of up to 40 um.
* Restore settings is now more reliable and settings do not get lost.


Concat for AutofocusScreen v2.1 - Release notes
This documents list all the features, enhancements and changes to the AutofocusScreen Macro
For detailed information of using Concat please refer to the User’s Manual. The Concat for AutofocusScreen is a modification of the originally published concat macro from Zeiss
Requirements
ZEN2010 or ZEN2011 (Black Edition) a microscope LSM710/780 (Macro v2.1 has only been tested on a LSM780)

Changes/Additions
* Faster concatenation
* Concatenates old format Lxxx_Rxxx.lsm  and new format Wxxx_Pxxx_Txxx.lsm
* If only one or more  positions should be concatenated this can now be marked with the mouse and then the concat will start after pushing “Concatenate Time MARKED location”
