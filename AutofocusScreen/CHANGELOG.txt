Version 2.1

Relevant changes to the user:

	* Setting for acquistion are read at the start of the macro. Any changes to pixel dwell time, Z-stacks etc 
	  must now be updated using Re-Initialize
	* Postfix for saving files uses a different format that conforms with Cellbase
		e.g. Position ("W"ell) 2 subposition ("P"osition) 1 and Repetion 3 ("T"time) reads --W00002--P00001--T00003.lsm
	* Cellbase format is also used for Additional acquisition and Micropilot acquistion
	* Corrected autofocus_button: Only the Z0Slice is changed during the acquisition. At the end the Zposition is updated if AutofocusTrackZ is on


New features/Bug fixes (visible to user)
	* Re-initialize updates the imaging setting not the macro parameters
	* Autofocus MaxSpeed setting is independet of acquisition setting. The macro tries to set minimal pixel dwell time for given imaging
	* Autofocus in the absence of piezo works als large z-Step. To use Fast Z-line pixel dwell time is adapted to the Z-step
	* More reliable StopButton and recovery of imaging setting 
	* Default output folder is loaded from registry ("OutputFolder"). If macro is used for the first time no default output folder 
	* Activation of Autofocus/Micropilot/Additional Acquisition etc. is now done by a similar "Active" checkbox. This automatically enable/disables minipages.
	* Crossdependency of modes is implemented by enabling/disabling features
	* The actual position is shown in  locations
	* After pressing start button acquistion always start at first position, first subPosition, first repetition. 
	* Continue from current location will start from current physical location (with correct numbering), and current repetition
	* Macro asks once if files should be overwritten
	* Micropilot and Additional acquistion works without piezo
	
Code changes (visible to developers)
	* Heavily clean up of unused and obsolete code commenting of (nearly) all functions. Function/Sub declartion and variable passing is now consistent.
	* Removing of many not necessary global variables.
	* Improved choice of tracks
	* MultipleLocation reads positions from stage when start is pressed (then stored in array). These positions are also updated. 
	  Previously it was continuously permuting marked position from stage 
	* GetOffssetValue uses now Autofocus_StackShift.
	* Tracking has been modified so that it does move in the same way as during Autofocusin (see next point)
	* All functions use for computing new coordinates and moving the same subroutine. This should simplify any problems in mapping
	  physical and image position
