    Version 2.0.5
    
    * Can run with mixed acquisition of piezo for AF and stage for
    acquisition (not recommanded anyway)
    * naming changed to Wxxx_Pxxx_Txxx.lsm or prefix_Wxxx_Pxxx_Txxx.lsm

    Corrected naming for files using in grid
    
    Stop after end of repetition button.
    Stop button activation is visible
    corrected error when start without a folder. When start is pushed the
    macro checks if folder exists and eventually creates a new one or stops

    * stage works with ZEN 2011 and Zen 2010. Still not vey precise fast-Z
    line
    * To fix: grid positions with 5x2 are not set correctly (in particaulr
    name of file)
    error when logging and start button without previously setting
    outputfolder. Should do all tests before the start
    imaging update is very sluggish

    Zen 21010 and Zen2011
    
    * Stage autofocus works with both programs. However fast z-line remains
    unprecise.
    * To fix:
    - scan frame doe snot work properly (aicha)
    - wrong naming of grid with 5x2
    - error using log file when start is pushed without having declared
    outputfolder
    - imaging update works very slow or not at all
    * feature:
    - log files but ont AF image when not in debug mode
    - show repetition name, position/ of total number of positions

Author: Antonio Politi <politi@embl.de>
Date:   Thu Jan 3 10:35:41 2013 +0100

    Major change in way of Autofocus
    
    *AutofocusButton: Now the Z movement is done after the full acquisition.
    Only the central slice is changed. This  spares time and gives more
    reliable result.
    
    * Fileformat is in agreement with Cellbase: well are numbered from the
    lest to the right. Top to bottom. Acquisition is still according to
    meandering.

    MaxSpeed for Autofocus
    
    * Micropilot and Additional acquistion work without piezo
    * All functions use for computing new coordinates and moving the same
    subroutine. This should simplify any problems in mapping
    physical and image position
    * Autofocus MaxSpeed setting is independet of acquisition setting. The
    macro tries to set minimal pixel dwell time for given imaging
    * Autofocus in the absence of piezo works als large z-Step. To use Fast
    Z-line pixel dwell time is adapted to the Z-step
    * All(?) functions use for computing new coordinates and moving the same
    subroutine. This should simplify any problems in mapping
    physical and image position
    * Tracking has been modified so that it does move in the same way as
    during Autofocusing (see next point)

    Saving and Multilocation/Grid has been improved
    
    Code:
    * Changed alternative imaging function
    * Large clean up of StartAcquisition. Extra function for creating
    GridPoints.
    * Changed reading of multiple locations from stage menu. Now it reads
    all positions at beginning of scan and puts into an array.  The order of
    the points is so maintained.
    Feature:
    * After stop system returns to first position or continue from current
    position, current time (extra button)
    * Saving format changed to W00001_P00001_T00001.lsm
    * Saving checks for overwriting of files

    Clean up, Automated enable of form via Active buttons
    
    * Removed old code for Grid which is not used anymore (large clean up of Stage_Grid.bas)
    * Outputflder is saved in registry and is automatically reloaded
    * Proper declaration of variables type  in Sub BatchHighresImagingRoutine and other for   Micropilot part of code
    * Improved choice of tracks in the code
    * Re-initialize now just look for new tracks
    * Activation of acquisition mode is done by the same active button. This automatically enable/disables minipages.
    * Cross dependency of acquisition modes is now visual in the form via enable/disable features

    Consistent usage of Stop scan throughall functions (need to finish test)
    Linescan without piezo accepts larger step by removing Fast Z-line.
    Todo: find optimal setting between scan speed and fast-Zline
    Clean up of code in several functions and simplification
    Commenting code and removed obsolete code
    Add ASCII files to repository

    Update of TODO list. Change in AutofocusScreen_ZEN to account for absecne of piezo and large z-Step in Z-line mode.
    It basically does not use fast Z-line if the stepping is too big.
