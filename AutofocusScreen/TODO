To do for version 2.1 

Major bug: autofocus on ScanFrame moves also x-y position (on Five-live ZEN2009)
	- in principle the macro works you just need to set properly how x and y are mirrored on the different microscopes
Minor bug: Sometime does not return to orginal setting. These get then lost

Major bug: Z-spacing without piezo for dz larger than a maximal size gave wrong results. The z-spacing was wrong with respect to the size that one wanted to span.
	- solved by implementing an extra check in the autofocus routine

Feature: Ask if overwriting images after Save. This should be done either for one or all the images (ask only once) 

Feature: mirror of axes

Clean up the code for unused stuff
Manual should be put up to date edited to explain better zoom-1 piezo, inactivated (?). These are all not very clear.
Explain how to start the macro with an example image
