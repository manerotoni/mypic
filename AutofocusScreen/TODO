To do for version 2.1 

Major bug: Password protection does not work

Major bug: autofocus on ScanFrame moves also x-y position (on Five-live ZEN2009)
	- in principle the macro works you just need to set properly how x and y are mirrored on the different microscopes
Minor bug: Sometime does not return to orginal setting. These get then lost.

Major bug: Z-spacing without piezo for dz larger than a maximal size gave wrong results. The z-spacing was wrong with respect to the size that one wanted to span.
	- solved by implementing an extra check in the autofocus routine

Bug?: Change the z-scan parameters within an acquisition. Is this possible (it seems but must look at it again). 

Feature: Ask if overwriting images after Save. This should be done either for one or all the images (ask only once) 
	Number files always with location. This keeps the overall structure the same. 	
Feature: mirror of axes

Feature: Speed of AF can't be set independently. Revert to similar setting as in version 1.7 where you have separate speed setting for the AF. 
	Alternatively max speed should be set everything to highest speed. 

Feature: Update also the menu when the values are updated for the acquisition setup

Clean up the code for unused stuff
Manual should be put up to date edited to explain better zoom-1 piezo, inactivated (?). These are all not very clear.
Explain how to start the macro with an example image
