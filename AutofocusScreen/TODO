To do for version 3 (eventually in the Workflow-Manager):

Feature: save setting of macro/ and original setting so to retrieve them after a crash
		 mirror axis feature
		
Maybe create a Autofocus macro independent of micropilot. Divide macros in different small macros that are called when needed.

A general window for setting specific tracks (for autofocus, micropilot etc).

FCS control

Tracing of crosses on cells to find volume and reset the z stacks

Non-linear timesampling 

Online changing of acquisition parameteres
