To do For version 4.2.3 (4.2.3.0 is development version)

Feature: save setting of macro

Major bug: autofocus on ScanFrame moves also x-y position (on Five-live)


Manual should be edited to explain better zoom-1 piezo, inactivated (?). These are all not very clear.
Explain how to start the macro with an example image



To do for version 5 :

Maybe create a Autofocus macro independent of micropilot. Divide macros in different small macros that are called when needed.

A general window for setting specific tracks (for autofocus, micropilot etc).
