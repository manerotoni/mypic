To do for version 2.1 

Major bug: autofocus on ScanFrame moves also x-y position (on Five-live ZEN2009)
	- in principle the macro works you just need to set properly how x and y are mirrored on the different microscopes
Minor bug: Sometime does not return to orginal setting. These get then lost

Major bug: Z-spacing without piezo for dz larger than a maximal size gave wrong results. The z-spacing was wrong with respect to the size that one wanted to span.
	- solved by implementing an extra check in the autofocus routine

Feature: Ask if overwriting images after Save. This should be done either for one or all the images (ask only once) 

Manual should be put up to date edited to explain better zoom-1 piezo, inactivated (?). These are all not very clear.
Explain how to start the macro with an example image



To do for version 3 (eventually in the Workflow-Manager):

Feature: save setting of macro/ and original setting so to retrieve them after a crash
		 mirror axis feature
		
Maybe create a Autofocus macro independent of micropilot. Divide macros in different small macros that are called when needed.

A general window for setting specific tracks (for autofocus, micropilot etc).

FCS control

Tracing of crosses on cells to find volume and reset the z stacks

Non-linear timesampling 

Online changing of acquisition parameteres
