To do for version 2.1 

Major bug: autofocus on ScanFrame moves also x-y position (on Five-live ZEN2009)

Minor bug: Sometime does not return to orginal setting. These get then lost

Manual should be edited to explain better zoom-1 piezo, inactivated (?). These are all not very clear.
Explain how to start the macro with an example image



To do for version 3 (eventually in the Workflow-Manager):

Feature: save setting of macro/ and original setting so to oretrieve them after a crash
		 mirror axis feature
		
Maybe create a Autofocus macro independent of micropilot. Divide macros in different small macros that are called when needed.

A general window for setting specific tracks (for autofocus, micropilot etc).

FCS control

Tracing of crosses on cells to find volume and reset the z stacks

Non-linear timesampling 

Online changing of acquisition parameteres
