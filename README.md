##Microscopy Pipeline Constructor: PipelineContructor.lvb (beta)
VBA macro to build and execute complicated imaging pipelines on Zeiss LSM microscopes.
You first setup a list of imaging and FCS settings to be used (jobSetter)
These can be concatenated to a default pipeline that will be executed at every position.
The macro allows to communicate with external programs using the windows registry.
