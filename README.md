# Microscopy Pipeline Constructor (MyPiC)

MyPiC is a Visual Basic for Application (VBA) macro to be used with Zeiss confocal microscopes running with the ZEN software (version black). The macro has been developed in the group of Jan Ellenberg, EMBL, Heidelberg and replaces the AutofocusScreenMacro.

The macro allows  

* Autofocus based on reflection and fluorescence multi-location time series
* Fluorescence based tracking using center of mass of fluorescence signal
* Multi-location time-lapse experiments
* Flexible combination of several independent Z-stack and channel settings
* Flexible combination of several fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements settings
* Adaptive Feedback microscopy support of two triggable imaging and FCS workflows

Please refer to the ![Wiki](https://git.embl.de/politi/mypic/wikis/home) for further explanations 
and examples.




> **Disclaimer:**
> MyPiC for ZEN has been tested on Zeiss LSM 780 microscopes with ZEN 2010, 2011, and 2012, and LSM880 microscopes with ZEN2.1 and ZEN2.3. We don’t guarantee that it will work on other configurations and we don’t take any responsibility for damage occuring during or after use of MyPiC.
