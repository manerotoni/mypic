Loading bugs:
	On a computer without VBA license (tested on ZEN2009 and ZEN2010)
	The Autofocus can't be loaded if protected by a password. 
	Using AFSloader gives error 'Macro edit not allowed'
	Using AFSloader with a non protected AutofocusScreen_ZEN macro still get 'Macro edit not allowed'
	Loading of AutofocusScreen_ZEN without macro works.
	
Compiling Bug:
	Somehow the macro does not recognize Chr(13) as a member of class Strings (MCUCommands). 
	Error is:
		Compile error in hidden module MCUCommands
	For version ZEN2011 the class is correctly recognized (rather puzziling)
	The same code in the Macro changed by tishi does not create this error.
Solution: If Chr(13) is replaced by String.Chr(13) then error is also gone on Zenn2009, 2010. This is changed in the main branch
